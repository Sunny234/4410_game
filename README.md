The game we wish to create is a 3D First Person Shooter game called "Back To Back Attack (BTBA)." It's an open world game that features multiple sections of enemies that increase in difficulty. It features a tutorial level so players can get introduced to the controls and concepts. The main objective of this game is for players to win by successfully defeating all enemies in each section without dying. But if the player loses all health then they lose and must restart the current section they're on or the entire game.
